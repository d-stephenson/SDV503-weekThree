 Answer:
 '24' != 24 //False
 != means not equals but is not strict 
 so '24' does equal 24 (String is converted to number)
 so 'does not equal' is false because it does equal 
 if it was:
  '24' !== 24 then it would be //True
  because in strict operator '24' does not equal 24 (String is NOT converted to number)

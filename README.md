Lab #Two

 Answer to Mondays class question:
 '24' != 24 //False
 != means not equals but is not strict 
 so '24' does equal 24 (String is converted to number)
 so 'does not equal' is false because it does equal 
 if it was:
  '24' !== 24 then it would be //True
  because in strict operator '24' does not equal 24 (String is NOT converted to number)

This week primarily focused on If/Else and Switch statements. These statements allow us to control what we want to do, in effect to control the output of the statement.

If/Else and Switch statements can be used to perform the same operation.

We also looked a ternary operators and how they can produce the same output as an if/else statement but over one line (ES6).

In conclusion, Javascript has many ways of performing the same operation, with no obvious rules as to when to use what. I'm sure once you are familiar with all the various routes of getting to the same outcome, and being able to decide which way of doing it is best, then it could be highly valuable...for learning however, definitely not the easiest thing to get your head around!!!
